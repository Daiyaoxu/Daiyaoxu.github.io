## Abstract

This is a simulation project of laser induced interstitial thermotherapy, also known as LITT. Laser-Induced Interstitial Thermotherapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive medical procedure that utilizes laser energy to generate heat, thereby treating targeted tissues. In this simulation project, we aim to model the complex interactions between laser light and biological tissues to optimize the LITT process. The project will focus on various parameters such as laser power, and exposure time, as well as tissue properties like thermal conductivity and absorption coefficients.

The simulation will employ computational methods like by using Monte_carlo method and Finite Difference Analysis (FDA) to solve the heat equation in a biological medium. This will help us understand the temperature distribution within the tissue during the LITT procedure. Additionally, we will incorporate real-time feedback mechanisms to adapt the laser parameters for optimal treatment outcomes. The project will also explore the safety margins by simulating potential risks such as overheating and thermal damage to adjacent tissues.
